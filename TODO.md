Reward system
1st level -> refer atleast 6 persons -> level1 achiever -> direct referral only
2nd level -> refer atleast 30 persons -> level2 achiever -> indirect referrals have 30 minimum
3rf level -> refer atleast 30 persons -> level3 achiever -> indirect referrals have 30 minimum
4th level -> refer atleast 30 persons -> level4 achiever -> indirect referrals have 30 minimum
5th level -> refer atleast 30 persons -> level5 achiever -> indirect referrals have 30 minimum

For withdrawing the amount, user should need to minimum invest in a project or in a plan

Here are few points which i understant, correct me if need to:
1. The referral system which rewards the user by invest, deposit and profit, will be removed, so the global referral comission would be removed.
2. And the reward system, which show the user thier levels, and show them thier rewards on that level, would be kept as it as now.
3. And copy the whole process of comission system into project basis (investment comission, deposit commission, and profit comission)
4. Also thier is products which they will be connected with projects (one product in a project, but same product will be in multiple projects)
5. Once user will invest into the project they will get the product a gift, and the order will be generated along with thier address, and the order status (which changed manually by the admin panel).

// remove plan investment completely
// remove from view files
// remove from routes
// remove models, git will do that
// remove services, git will do that
// remove scheduers & queues, git will also do that
// remove all other files related to plan investment, git will do that
// remove table, migation will do that

Implement hidden captcha for login/register/contact form
referral logo needed to be changed
also add export to the withdrawl table in admin panel
